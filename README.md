# AM10-Final Project Proposal (Group 15)

As weeks after their official ending, the US elections are still making headlines every day, it is our aim to have a closer look at the results from the US elections, and examine underlying trends in voting behaviour. The data can be found under the following link:

This data will be supplemented with other statistics depending on the question at hand

More specifically, we will attempt to answer **the following questions**:
- How fair is the per county voting system?
- How are votes devided throughout the country?
- How do factors like race, unemployment, salary and gdp influence votes?
- Is there any relation between peaks in Covid-19 cases and votes?
- How are the results different from the 2016 elections?

The analysis will be EDA-based, meaning that we will attempt to tell our story through a series of visualisations.
